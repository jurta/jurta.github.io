This post starts a feed with the tag <em>emacs</em> where I plan to provide Emacs related information. You can subscribe to emacs-only posts using the url http://www.jurta.org/en/tags/emacs/feed.

This week GNU Emacs will see the final pretest before the next 22.3 release. Everyone is invited to download the 22.2.92 pretest tarball at http://alpha.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/pretest/ and test it. Thanks!
