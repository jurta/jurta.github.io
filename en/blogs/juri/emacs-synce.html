<p>Good news. Yesterday at my request a support for Synce devices was added to GNU Emacs. After the trunk was opened a week ago, Michael Albinus checked in a patch that supports gvfs in Tramp. When I saw this I had a thought about synce because I just recently tried to browse files on my HTC Touch with a synce-gvfs package. I was able to open a directory in Nautilus using an address <i>synce://TOUCH/</i> but I don't like graphical file managers. When I asked Michael he kindly added a support for synce as well, so now it is possible to browse files, open, edit, copy, move, delete, etc. on a mobile device using Emacs:</p>
